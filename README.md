CSSE304 explores how programming languages are designed and implemented. Students will learn functional programming with Scheme, work with BNF syntax, and build their own Scheme interpreter. The course focuses on program transformations, macros, and continuations, encouraging new ways of thinking about code. Regular coding practice, homework, and exams ensure mastery of concepts. Help is available through office hours, TAs, and online resources. The course emphasizes curiosity, problem-solving, and deep understanding of programming languages.
