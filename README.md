CSSE304 explores how programming languages are designed and implemented. I learned functional programming with Scheme, worked with BNF syntax, and built my own Scheme interpreter. The course focused on program transformations, macros, and continuations, encouraging new ways of thinking about code. The course emphasized curiosity, problem-solving, and deep understanding of programming languages.
